# Casper

The default theme for Ghost, as a static site.

## Get started

This blog template uses [Harp](http://harpjs.com), the static web server with built-in preprocessing.

The fastest way to get this blog online is [by using this template on the Harp Platform](https://harp.io/apps/new?boilerplate=kennethormandy/hb-casper). Choose a subdomain, connect to your Dropbox, and this template will be online and ready to make your own.

Then, if you’d like, install Harp locally and run the boilerplate:

```sh
sudo npm install -g harp
harp server ~/Dropbox/harp.io/apps/the-subdomain-you-chose.harp.io
```

You can see the local version running in your browser at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

### Deploying elsewhere

If you’re prefer to run this boilerplate without the Harp Platform, that’s no problem. Just clone the boilerplate and serve it with Harp locally:

```bash
sudo npm install -g harp
git clone https://github.com/kennethormandy/hb-casper.git
harp server hb-casper
```

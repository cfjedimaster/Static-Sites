This little posts will introduce you to Markdown in Harp. Go ahead and edit the `welcome-to-harp.md` file to get going and learn how it all works!

## Getting Started

Writing in Markdown is really easy. Where appropriate, you can use *formatting* shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:

* Item number one
* Item number two
    * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://harpjs.com - it’ll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here’s a link to [the Harp website](http://harpjs.com). Neat.

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Harp Logo](http://harpjs.com/identity/resources/750/harp-wordmark-white-on-blue.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That’s ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing.

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn’t enough, you want to quote someone on what they’ve said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now – it’s definitely a word.

> Wisdomous – it’s definitely a word.

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We’ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? Using <code>```</code> at the beginning and end of the block gets you there.

```css
.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you’ve got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There’s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I’m an input field!" />

That should be enough to get you started with Markdown.
